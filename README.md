# BubbleBabble
[//]: # (TODO indicate if we won/position)
BubbleBabble is a game made in one week as a qualification for an intercollegiate Game Jam. The time constraint was 7 days, but we couldn't work on it full time due to class. Our team won a place to represent our college Édouard-Montpetit. The imposed theme was "Bubbles", therefore we developped a BattleRoyale game in a 2 to 4 local multiplayer with joystick controls.
