# BubbleBabble
Game made in one week as a qualification for a intercollegiate game jam. Our team (failed like shit|won a place|won second place|won first place) to represent our college Ã‰douard Monpetit. Imposed theme was "Bubbles" so we developped a BattleRoyale game mode in a 2 to 4 local multiplayer.
