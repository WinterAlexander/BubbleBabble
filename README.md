# BubbleBabble
[//]: # (TODO indicate if we won/position)
Game made in one week as a qualification for a intercollegiate game jam. It was one week long but we couldn't work on it full time due to our courses. Our won a place to represent our college Édouard Monpetit. Imposed theme was "Bubbles" so we developped a BattleRoyale game mode in a 2 to 4 local multiplayer with joystick controls.
