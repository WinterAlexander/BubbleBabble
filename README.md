# BubbleBabble
Game made in one week as a qualification for a intercollegiate game jam. Our team (failed like shit|won a place|won second place|won first place) to represent our college Édouard Monpetit. Imposed theme was "Bubbles" so we developped a BattleRoyale game mode in a 2 to 4 local multiplayer.

### Whirpool
Upon activation, a whirlpool is spawned on your location. The whirlpool sucks enemies in a swirling pattern. The whirlpool moves slowly and lasts only a few seconds. It is possible to get out of the whirlpool and the caster is immune to it.

Red bubble enjoys himself while the three other players are fighting furiously against the wrath of the whirlpool.
